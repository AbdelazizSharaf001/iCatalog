<h2>Why 2!</h2>
Started from version 2 as this project is a continue of a
previous version of native flask app that was not completed

dispite incompletion, all starting modules has been changed
for educational purposes so it's now is from step 2 to let
myself remember how log it taken me to learn and what I gained
</pre>

# Disclaimer

> This repo is initiated for educational purposes

- We do our best to enhance this app,
  <br>but tt's still not recommended to use the app as is
  in production without working arround it's security

- For educators: Even if you have the right to use the
  <br>code as you want as you refer to the auther copyrigts,
  
  I advice you to write the code yourself in the
  <br>beginning so you understand what have been written and
  <br>thin you could work around it well
  > this msg is especially for Udacity-FSND learners
  
- I'm also not responsple for any kind of usage of
  <br>this code except by me, you are the only responsple of
  <br>what you do.
